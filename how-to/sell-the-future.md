In order to create a better future, we have to first imagine a future with less problems. In order to imagine that universe, problems must first exist. Our rocket is headed towards the dry cleaning universe. **We are solving problems for the dry cleaning universe using voice technology powered by AI**. Our universe is old, stagnant, and ripe for innovation. Our universe has gone decades without significant innovation. Our universe has many problems needing solved. Kingdoms are in ruin. **The kings and queens face a young new world embracing technology and instant access to services.**

## 2. Create a Promise for a Better Future

Once you're strong enough, create a promise for a better future:

###  Appointment Call

The purpose of the appointment presentation is one thing and one thing only: _to make an appointment_ 

State problem and how you can control it

> **VDC:** "Hi, Mr. Jackson,  
> I am Pat Sweetman with VoiceDryCleaner.com. Have you seen the remarkable new things that are being done to manage your dry cleaning business these days?"

> **Mr. Jackson:** "What new things?"

> **VDC:** "Well, that's exactly why I called. May I have a moment of your time?"

### Learn & Be Curious

The first thing you do in this presentation is repeat what you said in the Appointment Presentation to:

1. Reestablish the emotional commitment.

> **VDC:** "Remember, Mr. Jackson, when we first talked I mentioned some remarkable new things going on in the world to manage your dry cleaning business?"



2. Describe how we want to proceed to fulfill promise.

> "Well, what I'd like to do is to tell you about those things. At the same time, I'd like to show you some incredibly effective ways my firm, VoiceDryCleaner.com, has developed to help you to control your dry cleaning business using AI. Okay?"

3. Establish credibility by communicating expertise and personal willingness to do whatever is necessary to utilize that expertise on their behalf.

> "Let me tell you why we created our company, Mr. Jackson. We've found that people like yourself are continually frustrated by not being able to get the most out of their dry cleaning business. Frustrated by paying for marketing and ads that don't work. By working with technology companies who don't seem to know what they're doing. By doing business with a tech company that doesn't seem to have their best interest at heart. By misunderstanding the rapidly changing habits of millenials and younger generations when it comes to dry cleaning... etc
>
> Do these things ever frustrate you, Mr. Jackson? Of course they do. And that's why VoiceDryCleaner.com has created an AI Assistant that makes it possible for you to get the most preferential treatment in the dry cleaning industry while paying the least for it. Now I know that sounds too good to be true. But let me explain how we propose to go about doing that for you..."

4. Describe the VoiceDryCleaner.com AI System and why it works so well. **Not** what it does but the impact it will have on them.

> "The VoiceDryCleaner.com's AI Assistant is designed to do three things, Mr. Jackson.  
>     First, it enables us to know what specifically bothers you about running your business. Because we know that running a business must be personally tailored to each and every one of our clients. In order to do that we've created what we call at VoiceDryCleaner.com an AI Business Questionnaire. By asking you these particular questions, we're well on our way to helping you get what you want. Before I leave today, I'll review the Questionnaire with you.  
>     Once the Questionnaire is completed, we return it to our AI Systems Group. This is a group of AI specialists who review your Questionnaire to make certain that it has been completed accurately.  
>     If it has, they enter the information into our AI Controlling System that has been designed to analyze this information and compare it with the broad spectrum of data we've assembled over the years. Once having analyzed the information, the System will then create personally tailored solutions just for you, Mr. Jackson. Ways to secure the kind of preferential treatment we talked about earlier, but at the lowest possible cost. Ways of controlling your business and using it to your advantage, not someone else's.  
>     These solutions will then be prepared in the form of an AI Report that I'll deliver to you personally and review with you at that time.  
>     Should any of our solutions make sense to you, we'll be more than happy to help you implement them. If not, then at least we'll have started the process of becoming better acquainted so that we may be of assistance to you some other time.  
>     In any case, the AI Report is yours - at absolutely no cost whatsoever. It's our way of saying we're serious about what we do, and would be happy to work with you, whether now or in the future.  
>     So let's review the Questionnaire together, and when we're done I'll provide you with a summary of some of the remarkable new things that are happening in the world to use AI to manage your dry cleaning business. And then I'll take your information back so we can prepare your AI Report. Okay?"

5. Complete the AI Business Questionnaire

6. Provide Mr. Jackson with the information he was promised and show him how relevant it is to the AI Report we will be preparing for them.

7. Make an appointment with the prospective customer to return with the AI report, reminding Mr. Jackson that we will have some valuable solutions for them - at no cost! - and that we will take whatever time is necessary to help Mr. Jackson understand those solutions, whether they decide to implement them or not!



## 3. Sell the Best System

Once you're strong enough, sell the best system. 

This is the easiest component of the selling process. Because if you have done your job effectively up to this point, the sale is already made.

### Solutions Call

1. Review everything we said during the Learn & Be Curious presentation.
2. Review the AI Report in detail.
3. Ask questions to make certain Mr. Jackson feels this is his AI Report, not VoiceDryCleaner.com's.

> "Of the options we've suggested here, Mr. Jackson, which do you feel would best serve you right now?"

Then wait for the answer. Because the next person who speaks is going to make a purchase. If that's us, we're going to buy a "no sale."

And that's all, except writing up the sale!
