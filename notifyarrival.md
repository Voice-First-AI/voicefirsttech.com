## Dry Cleaning in the Car

Does your business offers drive-thru pickup?  
What about "on my way" alerts so you can have their order ready when they arrive?  
Do you prep your customer's orders for pickup when they call to let you know they are on their way?

The biggest use-case for voice right now is in the car: 

> _"twice as many U.S. adults have used voice in the car and monthly active users are 60% higher...What we found was the car is firmly established as one of the big three voice assistant access points along with smartphones and smart speakers." -_ [voicebot.ai](https://voicebot.ai/2019/01/15/twice-the-number-of-u-s-adults-have-tried-in-car-voice-assistants-as-smart-speakers/)

Your customers have returned to **pick up their treasure**. They trusted you to clean and protect their most prized possessions. They left their home kingdom and are now headed to your kingdom of dry cleaning. They are riding caravans. Your kingdom is the last stop on their adventures before they return to their homes. Your customers are exhausted. They want a magical experience when picking up their newly cleaned treasures. 

Prepare for their arrival with fanfare!

You can welcome them by name! Have their order ready. Maybe even a little something special like a piece of candy for the kids. 

How do your customers tell you they are on their way? Their hands are busy driving so they can't open your website or mobile app. Do all of your customers have your phone number memorized to call to let you know? They won't be able to Google Search and drive. 

Amazon Alexa Auto is your Artificial Intelligence assistant for your business.
